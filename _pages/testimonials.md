									<ul class="submenu">
										<li>These guys really are the best. I've ordered shingles from them at 3pm, and they had them loaded on the roof by 4:30pm. Excellent pricing. Fast delivery. Great hours of operation. And a very helpful crew! We've used them for 20+ jobs now! No complaints!</li>

										<li>As a General Contractor/Interior Designer and a small business owner, its wonderful to be able to pick up the phone, order products for my projects and have them delivered a day or two later. It makes my job easier having Arrowhead as a business partner.</li>

										<li>Our sales have quadrupled due to the fast service of Arrowhead’s three-hour delivery.  Neighbors of our clients become customers because of the precise timing of our deliveries.  The roof is delivered; we show up and put it on.  They never saw this level of service coming.  We’d like to thank the Pevely Arrowhead team for their help in growing our business!</li>

										<li>I use Arrowhead Building Supply for 2 simple but very important reasons.  Everyone at Arrowhead is knowledgeable about their products, and sincerely committed to customer service.  They are always available to advise me on the best materials for the job and they make every effort to deliver them in a timely fashion.</li>

									<ul class="submenu">
										<li>I’ve done business with Arrowhead for over 5 years, and it’s one of the greatest business decisions I’ve made. Their service is just unbelievable. Their customer service is spot-on. Anytime I need something they are there for me. The way they deliver and take care of dump trailers removes a lot of my job-site concerns. Also, if I suddenly need a roof tomorrow, I know I can call them and have that roof delivered the next day, on time and the way it’s supposed to be. I absolutely recommend them to any contractor. Give Arrowhead a call and I guarantee they can help you.</li>

								<li>
									<div class="link">Homeowner, Fayetteville<div class="testarrow"></div></div>
									<ul class="submenu">
										<li>These folks really impressed me! I went in with a shingle from an older roof and they knew exactly what it was and matched it perfectly when 4 other local places could not, nor really wanted to, try for a small job. The size of the job did not seem to matter to Arrowhead, but only that the customer is happy. The Arrowhead guys were very helpful and friendly and took time to answer questions. They have many products other than shingle,s too. Will definitely shop here again!</li>
