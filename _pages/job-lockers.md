							<p>We take care of several construction job site issues within one handy metal container. Renting a Job Locker does the following for you:</p>
							
							<li>Delivers your Arrowhead product (typically siding and windows) to the jobsite in a tamper- and weather-resistant security locker (you supply the padlock)</li>
							<li>Appears professional, accepts your magnetic signs, and does not destroy a customer’s property</li>
							<li>Protects your materials and tools from the elements and thievery while keeping you organized</li>
							<li>Saves you time and money when we pick it up after your project is completed. If you have items to return, simply keep it in the locker, and we’ll take care of the paperwork upon its return</li>
							<p>There is a fee structure for renting a Job Locker. The delivery and pick-up of the Job Locker is free. Call your local Arrowhead Building Supply for more details.</p>
