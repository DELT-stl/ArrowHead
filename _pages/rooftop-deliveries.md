							<p>Arrowhead is known for innovations in roofing delivery truck mechanics. We design and build roofing truck long-loaders that deliver to roofs pitched 10/12, 12/12 and steeper. With truck-mounted roofing conveyors reaching 54’ – 61’, we can reach up to a 5-story building height, which removes the need of renting a crane. There’s no such thing as a roof we can’t place shingles on.</p>
							<p>With a fleet of over 40 shingle delivery trucks ready to go at any time, and a dedicated team of rooftop technicians, you and your homeowner will appreciate skill, speed and efficiency of Arrowhead’s free rooftop delivery service.</p>
